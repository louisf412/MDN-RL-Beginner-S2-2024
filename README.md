**environment.py**
Code that creates a car agent and places it on a track defined by a series of lines. Allows for control of car using arrow keys and prints a message to the terminal when the car is colliding with any of the lines.
**Trackdrawer.py**
Helper code that allows you to draw a track in a window (left click to start and continue placing lines, right click to stop), which will be output in a text file as a list of code lines that can be copied into **CarGame**.__init__ to define and draw the track in the environment.py window.
